# SS3selex

This repository contains files from the Interactive Stock Synthesis
Working Session that took place at the CAPAM Selectivity Workshop on
Monday 11 March 2013. 

Workshop information is available at
http://www.capamresearch.org/selectivity/workshop. 
Recordings of all presentations, including the SS3 session, are
available at

(in .wrf format and require WebEx Player).

The model files have been updated to Stock Synthesis 3.30.20 format, but
the R script for getting selectivity uncertainty for each fleet hasn't
been updated and may not currently work. Nevertheless it can serve as an
example of one approach to this task.

The example models and associated figures were from an experiment where
6 age-based and 5 size-based selectivity functions were fit to the same
data in order to compare the resulting shapes and the associated
uncertainty as shown in the figures below.
